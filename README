This is the Shirley Reduced Basis (SRB) version of Quantum Espresso.
The SRB is reduced order model for PWDFT that coarsely samples the BZ.
To use the SRB, add this namelist to your input files:
 &srb
  use_srb = .true.
 /
You also need to define Q_POINTS, which are the sparse BZ sample
used to build the basis (+ periodic mirrors specified by ntrans)  For
3D bulk systems, start with:
 Q_POINTS crystal
  7
  0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
  0.5 0.0 0.0 1.0
  0.0 0.5 0.0 1.0
  0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0
  0.0 0.5 0.5 1.0
  0.5 0.5 0.0 1.0
  0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0

For 2D sheets in the x-y plane:
 Q_POINTS crystal
  7
  0.0  0.0  0.0 1.0
  0.25 0.0  0.0 1.0 
  0.5  0.0  0.0 1.0 
  0.75 0.0  0.0 1.0 
  0.0  0.25 0.0 1.0 
  0.0  0.5  0.0 1.0 
  0.0  0.75 0.0 1.0 

These can be tweaked based on the physics of the system.

There are additional optional parameters:
 * basis_life (int) sets the number of SCF iterations each basis is
   used for.
   * Default: 1
   * Recommended: 3
 * ntrans(1:3) (int) defines the number of periodic mirrors of the
   unit BZ, [0:1]^3, in which to translate k-points.
   * Default: 1
   * Recommended: ntrans(i) = 0 for i without k-points, e.g. i=3 for x-y sheet
 * trace_tol (double) defines largest tolerated error in the norm of the
   overlap matrix composed of bands at the input q-points.  This is 
   analogous to the maximum variance removed in principal component analysis.
   Negative values are treated as zero.
   * Default: 1.D-7
   * Recommended: 1.D-7
 * max_basis_size (int) puts an upper limit on the size of the basis.
   Negative values are treated as infinity.
   * Default: -1
   * Recommended: -1 (use trace_tol instead)
 * rho_reduced (logical) specifies the use of the dense, reduced density
   matrix method, which faster when 4*nbnd*nq > nbasis
   * Default: .true.
   * Recommended: .true.
 * proj_tol (double) defines the largest tolerated error in the norm of the
   overlap matrix composed of projectors at the input k-points.  Similar
   to trace_tol, but for projectors and exact (no Shirley interpolation)
   * Default: 3.D-3
   * Recommended: 3.D-3
 * freeze_basis (double) defines the energy convergence at which to stop
   updating the basis.  Negative values signal to use sqrt(conv_thr)
   * Default: -1
   * Recommended: -1
 * srb_debug (logical) specifies the inclusion of debugging checks, mostly
   in the procedure to build the basis
   * Default: .false.
   * Recommended: .false.
 * use_cuda (logical) specifies the use of GPU accelerated routines
   * Default: .false.
   * Recommended: .true. if you have GPU's in your system
